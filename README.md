## **2. Commercial Use – Commercial License**

If you intend to use this software for any commercial, revenue-generating, or business-related purposes, you must obtain a separate
commercial license from the copyright holder.

### **2.1 Definition of Commercial Use**

Commercial use includes, but is not limited to:

- Incorporating the software into a product or service that is sold or licensed for a fee.
- Using the software to provide Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) or subscription-based offerings.
- Using the software for internal business operations that generate revenue.
- Redistributing the software as part of a commercial solution.

### **2.2 Licensing Fees**

If your use qualifies as commercial, the following fee structure applies:

#### **SaaS / Subscription Services**

If you offer a service similar to Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) or subscription-based offerings:

- **Fee:** 20% of the **Total Commercial Contract Value** associated with the offering that includes this software.
- **Cap:** Monthly fee not to exceed **USD 3,000**.

> The fee for the subscription service is calculated based on the number of subscribers to the subscription service, not the number of
> subscription services. For example, if your platform has 10 clients who have subscribed to services that include this software, the
> contractual quantity is 10, and each requires separate licensing.

#### **On-Premises / Perpetual License Deployment**

If you provide the software via on-premises deployment or perpetual license:

- **Fee:** 20% of the **Total Commercial Contract Value** of the contract that includes delivery of this software.
- **Cap:** One-time fee not to exceed **USD 50,000**.
- **Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Contract:** If an Operations and Maintenance (O&M) contract is established for the overall software
  solution, an additional fee of 10% of the **Total Contract Value** of the O&M contract will be charged. This fee is capped at **USD 30,000
  per year**. The "Total Contract Value of the O&M contract" refers to the total value of all commercial activities related to the usage,
  support, and maintenance of the overall software solution after its initial deployment. This includes, but is not limited to, activities
  such as adding, modifying, or removing software features (whether for this software or any other components included in the overall
  solution), as well as any other form of operational support and maintenance performed for the client.

#### **Definition of Total Commercial Contract Value**

The **Total Commercial Contract Value** refers to the entire contractual amount for all deliverables and services provided under the
agreement, regardless of whether other non-software services or components are included.

#### **Scope of Service and Restrictions on Commercial Use**

1. **Support Services:** All fees paid by the User under the aforementioned license, regardless of their designation, are strictly for the
   purchase of or subscription to the right to use this software. Unless otherwise explicitly agreed upon in writing, these fees **do not
   include any form of technical support, training, consultation, customization, development, operational maintenance, or other value-added
   services**.

2. **Commercial Use License:**
   a. Any use of this software for direct or indirect commercial purposes, including but not limited to use in profit-generating activities,
   internal operations, or integration into commercial products or services, shall be deemed "Commercial Use".  
   b. All Commercial Use **must** be based on a separate, formally executed written license agreement (hereinafter referred to as the "
   Master Agreement") between the User and the software provider. The standard terms, prices displayed on this platform, and any
   preliminary communications conducted via online links, forms, chat, etc., **do not constitute the grant of a Commercial Use license**.  
   c. Any expression of interest regarding Commercial Use is to be considered solely as a preliminary starting point for commercial
   negotiations and does not create any binding license or commitment. All final rights, obligations, fees, and scope of services shall be
   exclusively governed by the Master Agreement formally executed by both parties.
